# Introduction
For all the ITF Taekwon-Do enthusiasts, this is a desktop app for randomly generating patterns for a given degree.

Originally, it was build for my club (https://www.torslandatkd.se). However, feel free to use.

Please note that it uses the Dioxus framework (https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus) and that unfortunately,
I have not gotten it to bundle properly, so at the moment, both Rust and Dioxus are needed for it to run.
